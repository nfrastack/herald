# Security

How to report security vulnerabilities in herald responsibly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Use one of these private channels:

- **Email**: [security@nfrastack.com](mailto:security@nfrastack.com?subject=%5BSECURITY%5D%20herald%20vulnerability%20report) with a `[SECURITY]` subject prefix
- **GitHub private vulnerability reporting**: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/nfrastack/herald/security/advisories/new) on the repository Security tab

Both land in the same place. Email is monitored, the GitHub advisory system keeps everything off the public tracker until a fix is ready.

## What to include

- Affected herald version (`herald --version`)
- Platform and architecture (eg `linux/amd64`, container vs bare binary)
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Impact assessment - what an attacker could do with this
- Any relevant configuration (redact credentials, tokens, and hostnames)

You do not need to be certain it is exploitable. If something looks wrong, report it.

## Response timeline

| Stage             | Target                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledgement   | 48 hours                                |
| Status update     | 7 days                                  |
| Fix or mitigation | Best effort, communicated during triage |

## Disclosure policy

Coordinated disclosure. Once a fix is available we will publish an advisory with credit to you unless you prefer to remain anonymous. We ask that you allow up to 90 days from initial report before public disclosure so users have time to patch.

## Scope

The following are in scope:

- The `herald` binary and its container image
- API server authentication and client token handling
- Configuration parsing and secret resolution (`file://`, `env://`)
- DNS provider integrations (Cloudflare, PowerDNS)
- Container entrypoint and init scripts

The following are out of scope:

- Social engineering of Nfrastack staff or users
- Denial of service attacks against public infrastructure
- Physical attacks on hardware
- Vulnerabilities in third party dependencies that are not reachable through herald

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release only. Older versions should upgrade.
